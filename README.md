# SynMars

We release SynMars, a wide-angle synthetic dataset for Martian rock segmentation. It was collected from a simulation environment generated by Blender, an open source and versatile 3-D computer graphics software allowing users to create and arrange 3-D objects. The simulated environment is a Mars-like terrain with an area of 100 x 100 m that is populated by thousands of rocks. We built this terrain by referring to the rock distribution photographed by TianWen-1. The distribution of all rocks in SynMars is displayed as follow, where 6 colored lines represent the traverse routes.

On each route, a virtual camera on a rover captured images with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The intrinsics and extrinsics of the camera were set according to those on the TianWen-1 rover such that the landform of SynMars is closer to that of the TianWen-1 dataset. 

We show a sample of each route as follow, where a background of undulating textured terrain, a foreground of Martian rocks with complex polygonal shapes, and a realistic lighting model casting shadows are well simulated.

All Martian rocks were annotated regardless of size in SynMars, which contributes to a better robustness evaluation of various Transformer-based methods. Limited by the file size, we temporarily release 1/5 samples of each route. The rest samples will be provided after our paper is made public.
